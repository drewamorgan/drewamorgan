        <p>Speaking of art galleries in NYC, the last one I visited was the American Folk Art Museum across from Lincoln Center on the Upper West Side. It's a very nice (albeit small) space, but currently they have a quite morbid exhibit displaying posthumous portrature where most of the subjects are children. So it's important to be in the right mood before you go. Click on the image below to learn more.</p>
